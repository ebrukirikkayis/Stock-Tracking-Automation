# Stock-Tracking-Automation
 The purpose of the Stock Tracking Automation project is to keep all the products in a store in stock and to ensure that these products can be controlled by the store manager or staff. The project consists of a login screen, admin panel, user panel and user editing panel. Stock operations include adding, updating and deleting products. In addition, product listing and filtering operations can also be performed. It has access authorization. The product can be deleted from the stock only via the admin panel. Likewise, users registered to automation can be listed and edited in the admin panel.
